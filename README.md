# Archived
This ng-onoff has some good days. We had a lot of fun. Now it looks like Angular 20 migration just did us. 
If somebody want to take it back feel free. It works until Angular 19. 

Bye bye :wave:

# Angular Component OnOff

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Nexucis/ng-onoff.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/Nexucis/ng-onoff) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ng-onoff.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ng-onoff) [![License](https://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg)](LICENSE.md)

This is an angular module that can be helped to integrate the original game [OnOff](https://github.com/starzonmyarmz/js13k-2018)

### Versioning
This project uses the following version rules: 

```
X.Y.Z
```

Where : 
* X is the major version of Angular supported by this project
* Y is the major version of this library. Be careful with this rule, you can have some breaking changes between two **Y** number. 
* Z is the minor version of this library. It will be increased when there are some bug fixes.

### Supported Version

| Angular Version | Support Branch  |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| >= 8.0          | master          |

## Installation

```bash
npm install ng-onoff --save
```

## Usage

First import NgOnOffModule in the module where you wish to display the game (it can be another module than the AppModule)

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { NgOnoffModule } from 'ng-onoff';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    NgOnoffModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

And then use the component in a container that suits you :)

```html
<div style="height: 100vh">
  <ng-onoff></ng-onoff>
</div>

```
